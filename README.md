# :gem: `prismeanalytics` - An Open Source, privacy-focused and progressive analytics service.

## Why is the repository empty ?

I've already built a closed source MVP of what Prisme Analytics may look like but
it's not until recently that I decided to open source it.

There will be a lot of changes in the following weeks, be sure to watch and star
the repository to get informed of the progress.
